======== Beta ========
When adding new folder on linux it doesn't detect changes in the files within it??
Add MbUnit support
Add support for versioned mstest runners (because of /category:"!Category1|!Category2" that's only supported for VS2010)
Implement support for VS2005 7.10.3077 and VS2003 project files
Run single test turned out pretty useless for MSTest.. figure out what's going on
Add test to ProjectChangeConsumer
Add system tests doing real work
Implement service locator properly (blog post)
Use a panel to make the link label scrolleable
Cleanup files in repo
Create vs addin to open file on right line
Move from WinForm to Gtk#
